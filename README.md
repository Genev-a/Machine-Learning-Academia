# Master of Statistics Portfolio üìä

Welcome to my Master of Statistics project repository! Here, you'll find a collection of some homeworks, exams and presentations completed during my Master of Statistic's program at California State University, Fullerton. Each project showcases applications of statistical methods and machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems.

I graduated with the higher distinction: summa cum laude and a 4.0 GPA, ranking #1 in my cohort. During the course of the program, I received 3 awards for my academic excellence & extracuricular activities:
- **Exceptional Graduate Student Award**: Award granted to honor graduating students who have demonstrated high academic achievement and/or outstanding accomplishments and service in the department.
- **Distinguished Phi Kappa Phi Member Award**: Monetary award offered to 10 Phi Kappa Phi student members who have excelled in their studies and extracurricular activities.
- **Non Residential Fee Waiver**: Highly competitive scholarship, based on academic excellence. Granted to very few students by the Department of Mathematics for the whole duration of their studies.

![Image for Statistical Computing](link-to-image)

**Content**: Focus on computational strategies for statistical analysis including simulation, numerical methods, and optimization, essential for handling complex data.

**Techniques Used**: Monte Carlo simulations, Bootstrap methods, EM algorithms, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Optimization algorithms:

- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Utilized for approximating the probability of complex events and solving quantitative problems. Techniques include:
  - Direct simulation for evaluating integrals and expectations.
  - Importance sampling to reduce variance and improve estimation efficiency.
  - Random walk Monte Carlo for exploring unknown probability distributions.

- **Bootstrap Methods**: Employed for assessing the variability of sample estimates by resampling with replacement from the original data, and for building better predictive models. Includes:
  - Non-parametric bootstrap for resampling data points.
  - Parametric bootstrap involving resampling based on parameter estimates.
  - Block bootstrap for correlated data, commonly used in time series analysis.

- **EM Algorithms** (Expectation-Maximization): A class of iterative algorithms used for finding maximum likelihood estimates in models with latent variables. Applications include:
  - Gaussian Mixture Models for clustering and density estimation.
  - Hidden Markov Models for temporal data analysis.
  - Latent Dirichlet Allocation in natural language processing.

- **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)**: A suite of algorithms that sample from probability distributions based on constructing a Markov chain that has the desired distribution as its equilibrium distribution. Key variants include:
  - Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for generating a sequence of samples from a probability distribution from which direct sampling is difficult.
  - Gibbs sampling, particularly useful when combined distributions are known and sampling from the marginal distributions is straightforward.
  - Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, which uses concepts from physics to inform smarter proposals.

- **Optimization Algorithms**: Techniques designed to find the maximum or minimum of an objective function. Employed widely in machine learning, economics, and operations research. Key types include:
  - Gradient Descent and its variants (Stochastic Gradient Descent, Mini-batch Gradient Descent) for minimizing functions by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent.
  - Newton's Method and Quasi-Newton Methods (like BFGS and L-BFGS) for more efficiently finding the stationary points of functions using curvature information.
  - Conjugate Gradient Method, used for solving systems of linear equations and nonlinear optimization problems without calculating the Hessian matrix.
