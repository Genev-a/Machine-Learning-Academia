# Master of Statistics Portfolio üìä

Welcome to my Master of Statistics project repository! Here, you'll find a collection of some homeworks, exams and presentations completed during my Master of Statistic's program at California State University, Fullerton. Each project showcases applications of statistical methods and machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems.

I graduated with the higher distinction: summa cum laude and a 4.0 GPA, ranking #1 in my cohort. During the course of the program, I received 3 awards for my academic excellence & extracuricular activities:
- **Exceptional Graduate Student Award**: Award granted to honor graduating students who have demonstrated high academic achievement and/or outstanding accomplishments and service in the department.
- **Distinguished Phi Kappa Phi Member Award**: Monetary award offered to 10 Phi Kappa Phi student members who have excelled in their studies and extracurricular activities.
- **Non Residential Fee Waiver**: Highly competitive scholarship, based on academic excellence. Granted to very few students by the Department of Mathematics for the whole duration of their studies.
