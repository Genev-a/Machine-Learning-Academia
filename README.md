# MS-Statistics-Projects
The repository contains some of the projects, assignments and exams completed during my Master of Statistics at 
California State University, Fullerton. 

Those projects are organized by subject and chronologically. This GitHub repository has 2 purpose: It is a personal ressource for me 
to have a quick access to my past projects. Secondly, they are now used for my future possible employers to have an overview of my knowledge
and expertise in Statistics as well as my evolution of the quality of my assignments over time.
